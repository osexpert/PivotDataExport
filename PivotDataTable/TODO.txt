total row?

subtotal groups?

merge props and fields?
Well...its not that easy. Props are static info that never change. These can be registered at start and reused by concurrent threads.
Field otoh, are new'ed for every request and customizable (sorting and groping and area), allthou the static parts of field (comparer, GetDisplayValue, datatype) could maybe be in the props...
So it would be more like DataField and DisplayField...

Make Field a type that can be sent via api.

POST /api/report
array of Field
{
[
FieldName
SortOrder
GroupIndex
FieldType
]
,
[
FieldName
SortOrder
GroupIndex
FieldType
]
}

result from POST is the report.
